This is the source code for my personal portfolio website. It showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a software engineer, with a focus on AI, web development, and innovative solutions.

Features
1. About Me Section: Introduction to who I am, my background, and what I do.
2. Resume Section: Downloadable and directly viewable version of my resume.
3. Projects Section: Highlights of my work.
4. Contact Section: Easy ways to reach out via email or social media.
5. Responsive Design: Fully optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

Technologies Used
1. React.js: Frontend framework for building the components.
2. Tailwind CSS: For styling and responsive design.
3. HTML/CSS: Structuring and styling core content.
4. JavaScript: Dynamic functionality and user interactions.

Some files in the projects are not being used but I still have them because I might need them in the future or I am just lazy to clean them.

Why do I need it?
1. I created it only to prove that I could do that in a few hours.
2. I noticed that almost every software engineer has a personal portfolio website
3. Also, a little more practice in React.js because I have not used it in a while

I might change something if I need to (like small design fixes and potential changes in my Resume)

I am also planning to make the projects section interactive (so you will be able to open my projects by simply clicking on them). I did not do it yet because some projects are still private.

You can use that project as a start for your portfolio. I made it very minimalistic because I love that kind of design(like Apple and Tesla)
